Since I failed miserably to finish my WPF project, this is my attempt to create the same type of browser game (Ogame) simulation but as a web application using API. 

It's still in progress.

For now, I learned about:
- architecture, how to structure application, what domain is
- how to mock data, create sample user in memory and test without launching an API
- LINQ usage
- Postman
- using abstract classes, interfaces, reflections
- CQRS, MediatR, Dependency Injection
- unit and integration tests
- extensions methods, handlers

And there are many more things to come.
